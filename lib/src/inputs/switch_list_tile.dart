/// The entire list tile is interactive: tapping anywhere in the tile toggles
/// the switch. Tapping and dragging the [ArnaSwitch] also triggers the
/// [onChanged] callback.
///
/// To ensure that [onChanged] correctly triggers, the state passed
/// into [value] must be properly managed. This is typically done by invoking
/// [State.setState] in [onChanged] to toggle the state value.
///
/// The [value] and [onChanged] properties of this widget are identical to the
/// similarly-named properties on the [ArnaSwitch] widget.
///
/// The [title] and [subtitle] properties are like those of the same name on
/// [ArnaListTile].
///
/// To show the [ArnaSwitchListTile] as disabled, pass null as the [onChanged]
/// callback.
///
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ArnaCheckBoxListTile], a similar widget for checkboxes.
///  * [ArnaRadioListTile], a similar widget for radio buttons.
///  * [ArnaListTile] and [ArnaSwitch], the widgets from which this widget is made.

  /// appearance of the switch.

  ///
  /// * [value] determines whether this switch is on or off.
  /// * [onChanged] is called when the user toggles the switch on or off.
